## About me
Good afternoon, my name is Konstantin. My goal is to achieve incredible heights in programming. 

I want to become such a specialist for whom there are no and will not be unsolved problems. I consider my strengths to be the **desire to learn everything new**, as well as very strong perseverance, and to get to the bottom of every detail. 

And when I solve some difficult programming problem, I become truly happy because I adore code.
